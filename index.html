			<p>I'm working my way through two textbooks at the moment, but it's been a couple of years since I last learnt maths and I can tell! So to help digest what I'm reading and then commit this to memory, I'm trying two approaches:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Theorem maps - a graph where nodes are theorems, lemma, or definitions, and directional edges show how these are built</li>
				<li><a href="https://www.ankiapp.com/">ANKI</a> - a spaced learning flashcard app</li>
			</ul>
		<p>The two textbooks I'm reading at the moment are 'Causality' by Pearl, and 'An Introduction to Statistical Learning' </p>
			<p><a href="Projects/Causality/Concept Map Causality Chp1 v0.1.png">Here's</a> an example of a Theorem map that covers the first couple of pages in Causality</p>
