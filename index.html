			<p>This website is a space for me to upload some of the projects I'm working on.</p>
			<p>It's been a couple of years since I last picked up a maths textbook, so when I first looked at 'Causality' by Pearl, and 'An Introduction to Statistical Learning' I found it more difficult than I would have imagined to really commit what I was learning to memory.</p>
			<p>To help with this I'm using two approaches:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://www.ankiapp.com/">ANKI</a> - a spaced learning flashcard app</li>
				<li>Theorem maps - a graph where nodes are theorems, lemma, or definitions, and directional edges show how these are built</li>
			</ul>
			<p><a href="Projects/Causality/Concept Map v0.1.png">Here's</a> an example of a Theorem map that covers the firt couple of pages in Causality</p>
